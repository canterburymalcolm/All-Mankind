            I am one of the least flamboyant and simple people you’ll ever meet.
            My signature outfit is a plain Uniqlo sweater with brown khaki pants
            and dirty white ASICS Gel Lytes, finished with a blue North Face bubble
            jacket. It’s ironic that I would venture into one of the most eccentric
            and expressive industries of our time. This begs the question:
            why streetwear?

            The streetwear phenomena is an absolute enigma to me. Maybe that’s
            what makes it so attractive. The legions of followers waiting in line
            for hours to buy a fire extinguisher. The symbolism that can command
            hundreds and thousands of dollars from people all over the world.
            The stickers. The shoes. The celebrity.

            Conventional marketing wisdom points to people’s desire to align
            themselves with a community that they think is cool. It’s not about
            wearing the brand; it’s about being a part of a movement. On the other
            hand, my friends tell me different. It’s not at all about being a part
            of a movement; if something is fire, then it’s fire. To my best estimate,
            it’s a lot more complex than either hypothesis, and it’s something I’ll
            never truly understand. At first, I didn’t really care. When I started toying
            with the idea of making a brand, it was merely because I thought it would be
            fun.

            This all changed when I was approached by John. The man is my polar
            opposite. He has a unique sense of style, rocks a pair of sleek earrings
            (don’t tell his mom), and is a true lover of the culture. The more we met
            and played with the idea of starting our own brand, the more my reasoning
            started to change.
        </p>
        <p>
            While John and I differed in many ways, we were the same in our love
            for comics and manga. We loved the storytelling, the lore, and the
            visuals. It was this love that formed the foundation for our idea: a
            streetwear brand that paid homage to the art style that is unique to
            comics and manga. With this mantra, the reason behind the brand evolved
            into something deeper: to make something new, meaningful, and different. To
            make art.

            Art is a reflection of its time. You can learn a lot about the world from a
            simple painting. Somewhere, buried beneath the rubble of corporate fashion,
            there is a form of streetwear that embodies this idea. In the future people
            will look back at what we wore and subconsciously form opinions on our
            generation. At All Mankind, we’d like to be a part of this. Hopefully, we can
            paint a unique vision of our times. One that reflects pop culture and zany
            visuals. One that pays respects to the art so many people grew up loving.

            A few months into our idea and we have a fleshed out plan on how
            we’re going to proceed. We’ve still got a lot to learn and a lot of
            mistakes to make. We’ve added a new member to our team, but we’ll
            kick him out once we finish the website (jk we need you Malcolm).
            Hopefully this is the beginning of something fresh and different.
            While people will or won’t buy our merch for various reasons, we’ll
            have a pretty good one to keep us going. So stay tuned true believers,
            the beginning has just begun.
