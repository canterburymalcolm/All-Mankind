                    Sebastian Sy is the ultimate fanboy. Born and raised in the mean
                    streets of Manila, this skinny 21 year old has fanboyed the likes of
                    Lebron James, Marvel Comics, and Philippine Scuba sites with a passion.
                    In his free time he likes showing off his enormous backpack, cracking jokes,
                    exploring world of Fried Chicken, and being an overall doofus.

                    Since a young child, John has wanted to be famous. This
                    whole brand is John’s pathetic effort to become famous and
                    relevant to the masses. Let’s hope it works.

                    Malcolm is a huge computer nerd with a good sense of style.
                    He’s one of those coffee geeks that drinks coffee all the time 
                    and know about the darknesses of the coffee and how to get to 
                    different consistencies and shit. Everything about Malcolm is 
                    pretty fast. He’ll be standing right next to you and then a 
                    second later will be skateboarding 20 feet away. It’s probably 
                    from all that coffee.
